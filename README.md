# MotionSensor

By utilizing the motion sensor on the top part of the phone, it can start another app after a user places their hand on it.

How to use:
--
First, an app needs to be selected for the given category. Click on a button in the list to set the app you want a specific color to open. Keep in mind that all apps will be selected, even if they cannot be opened.

Once an app has been selected, you can place your hand over the sensor to cause a bar at the bottom of your phone to light up. It will first look brown to indicate it is too early to start the app.
* However, once it reaches a bar, the bar will then turn red, showing that if you remove your hand at this point, it will start the app in the 'red' section, assuming one has been selected.
* This will continue for colors orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. 
* Once the bar passes purple, it will turn black to show that no apps can be opened and you must move your hand away to reset it.
